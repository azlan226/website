    <h1 class="headings">1-Bicep Curl</h1>
    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/dumbbell-standing-biceps-curl.webp" alt="">
    <p class="text">To perform a standing bicep curl, stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward. Keep your elbows close to your torso, and slowly curl the weights upward while contracting your biceps. Avoid swinging your body or using momentum to lift the weights. Lower the weights back down in a controlled manner. The standing bicep curl primarily targets the biceps brachii, with secondary activation of the brachialis and forearms. It helps in building arm strength, increasing muscle size, and improving grip strength, making it a key exercise for developing well-defined arms.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">2-Tricep Pushdown</h1>
    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/Tricep-pushdown-movement_ddb8dbd8-566d-4f55-99e0-36c35790234a_1224x.png.webp" alt="">
    <p class="text">To perform the tricep pushdown, stand at a cable machine with a rope or bar attachment set at the top. Grip the handle with palms facing down, elbows at your sides, and forearms parallel to the ground. Push the handle downward until your arms are fully extended, keeping your elbows stationary. Slowly return to the starting position with control. The tricep pushdown primarily targets the triceps brachii, focusing on the long, lateral, and medial heads of the triceps. This exercise helps to build arm strength, muscle definition, and improve overall upper arm size. It also isolates the triceps, reducing the involvement of other muscle groups, making it ideal for enhancing arm aesthetics and strength.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">3-Wrist Curl</h1>
    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/dumbbell-reverse-wrist-curl-benefits.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="text">To perform a wrist curl, sit on a bench with your forearms resting on your thighs and your wrists hanging off the edge, holding a dumbbell or barbell in each hand with palms facing upward. Keeping your forearms stationary, curl your wrists upwards, then slowly lower the weights back to the starting position. The wrist curl primarily targets the flexor muscles of the forearm, particularly the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus. It helps to strengthen and build the forearm muscles, improving grip strength and endurance. Wrist curls are beneficial for activities that require forearm strength, such as weightlifting, climbing, or sports requiring strong handshakes or grips.</p>
