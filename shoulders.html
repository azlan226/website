    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/Dumbbell_Shoulder_Press_Muscles_600x600.png-6.webp" alt="">    
    <p class="text">The shoulder press is performed by pressing weights overhead from shoulder level while keeping the core engaged and back straight. This can be done seated or standing using dumbbells, a barbell, or a machine. It's important to avoid arching the lower back and to control the movement both up and down. The shoulder press primarily targets the deltoid muscles, especially the anterior (front) delts, while also engaging the triceps and upper chest. It helps build shoulder size, strength, and stability, and supports better performance in pushing movements and overhead activities.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">2-Lateral Raises</h1>
    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/images-2.jpeg" alt="">
    <p class="text">Lateral raises are performed by holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides, then lifting the arms outward to shoulder height, keeping a slight bend in the elbows. The movement should be slow and controlled, with a focus on using the shoulders to lift the weights rather than the traps or back. Lateral raises primarily target the lateral deltoids (middle part of the shoulder), helping to increase shoulder width and definition. This exercise also engages the anterior deltoids and stabilizes the upper back. Regularly performing lateral raises improves shoulder strength, posture, and overall upper body symmetry.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">3-Face Pulls</h1>
    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/cable-standing-face-pull.webp" alt="">
    <p class="text">The face pull is performed by using a rope attachment on a cable machine set at upper chest height. Stand facing the machine, grab the rope with both hands, and pull it towards your face while keeping your elbows high and out to the sides. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull. The face pull primarily targets the posterior deltoids (rear shoulders), but also engages the upper traps, rhomboids, and external rotators of the shoulder. This exercise is excellent for improving posture, balancing shoulder strength, preventing injuries, and enhancing shoulder stability. It helps to strengthen the muscles that support shoulder health and upper back posture, making it a key movement for both aesthetic and functional fitness.</p>
