    <p class="text">The bench press is a fundamental compound exercise that primarily targets the chest muscles (pectoralis major), along with the triceps and front shoulders (anterior deltoids). To perform it with proper form, lie flat on a bench with feet firmly on the ground, grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width, lower it slowly to your chest, and push it back up in a controlled motion. Good form ensures maximum muscle engagement and reduces the risk of injury.</p>

<h1>2-Incline Dumbell-Press:</h1>  
<img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/2_3b458939-656d-42a7-ab89-3f827f6b9a83.jpg.webp" alt="">
<p class="text">The incline dumbbell press is a powerful upper chest exercise that targets the upper portion of the pectoral muscles, along with the shoulders and triceps. To perform it correctly, sit on an incline bench set at about 30â€“45 degrees, hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level, and press them upward while keeping your elbows slightly bent. Lower the dumbbells in a controlled motion until they're level with your chest, then press back up. This exercise helps build a well-rounded chest and improves shoulder stability and pressing strength.</p>

<h1>3-Flyers: </h1>
<img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/2_3b458939-656d-42a7-ab89-3f827f6b9a83.jpg.webp" alt="">
<p class="text">Flyers, or dumbbell flyes, are performed by lying on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, arms extended above the chest, and then slowly lowering the arms out to the sides in a wide arc while keeping a slight bend in the elbows. The movement should be controlled and smooth, focusing on stretching and contracting the chest muscles. This exercise primarily targets the pectoralis major (chest), and also engages the anterior deltoids (front shoulders) and biceps to a lesser extent. Flyes are useful for developing chest width and definition, improving muscle balance, and enhancing mind-muscle connection through isolation.</p>
