    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/How_to_Do_a_Leg_Extension.jpg.webp" alt="">
    <p class="text">The leg extension is performed on a machine where you sit with your back against the pad, place your feet under the padded bar, and adjust the machine so that your knees are aligned with the pivot point. From there, extend your legs fully, squeezing your quadriceps at the top, and then slowly lower the weight back down. The leg extension primarily targets the quadriceps (front thigh muscles), specifically the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and rectus femoris. It helps in building muscle mass and strength in the quads, improving knee stability, and enhancing performance in activities that require leg power. Regular use also contributes to better muscle definition and overall lower body strength.</p>

    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/lever-lying-leg-curl.webp" alt="">
    <p class="text">The leg press is performed on a machine where you sit with your back firmly against the seat and place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform. Lower the platform by bending your knees, keeping them aligned with your toes, and avoid letting your knees cave inward. Push the platform back to the starting position without locking your knees. The leg press primarily targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. It is an excellent exercise for building lower body strength, improving muscle mass, and enhancing overall leg development. It also helps to strengthen the hip and knee joints, making it a valuable movement for both athletic performance and functional fitness.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">2-Leg Press</h1>
    <img style="height: 250px; width: 300px;" src="images/images-3.jpeg" alt="">
    <p class="text">To perform the leg press, sit on the machine with your back and hips against the seat pad. Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform, ensuring your knees are aligned with your toes. Push the platform upward by extending your legs, but avoid locking your knees at the top. Slowly lower the weight by bending your knees, keeping them in line with your toes. The leg press primarily targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Itâ€™s a great exercise for building lower body strength, improving muscle mass, and enhancing leg power. Additionally, it helps to develop joint stability in the knees and hips, making it effective for overall leg development and functional fitness.</p>
